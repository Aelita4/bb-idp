# Value of functions
Write a program to determine the values of functions defined by formulas for real arguments given as input:
```
a(x) = 2x for x > 0
a(x) = 0 for x = 0
a(x) = -3x for x < 0
```
```
b(x) = x^2 for x >= 1
b(x) = x for x < 1
```
```
c(x) = 2 + x for x > 2
c(x) = 8 for x = 2
c(x) = x - 4 for x < 2
```

## Input:
Digit determining the function and the value of x

-----

## Output:
The value of the function
